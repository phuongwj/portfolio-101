This website is currently being deployed under branch `main`. Initially, I have my rough layout for `v1` but quickly came to realize that the page was too packed 
and doesn't really give a minimalistic feel. Therefore, I am working on a more refined version of my website, giving a new layout and colour theme. Please hang
on! I am going through a rough semester with trying to get at least A- for all of my courses, being a teaching assistant for 2 courses, doing Grind75 on Leetcode 
and actively searching for Summer 2025 Co-ops, this website will for sure be finished and live up to everyone's expectations :D

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
