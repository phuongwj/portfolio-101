/*
Make the scroller like monkeytype lol, it's pretty darn good.
I don't know how the boxes are gonna be like because of the
color contrast stuffs, I've created a testing div inside 
Header.jsx to see how the color contrast works out, so be 
sure to check that out. 
Maybe make it similar to monkeytype, but make it different too
because you don't want it to be too similar you know.

- Do the box similar to the testing box inside Header.jsx
